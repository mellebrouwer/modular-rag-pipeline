generate a single SQLite query that answers the question. Only return the SQL query, nothing else.
Follow these rules:
1. Only output the SQL query, no explanations
2. Use proper SQLite syntax
3. Make queries efficient and specific
4. Don't use functions or syntax that doesn't exist in SQLite
5. For temporal queries, use proper datetime comparisons
6. Always use double quotes for string literals
Example schema and output format:
Schema: Table users: name (TEXT), age (INTEGER)
Query: "Find all users over 30"
SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 30;"""
